## Rogen George

I am graduate student in Oregon State University advised by Dr. Weng Keen Wong. My research focuses on applying Machine Learning techniques on Compositional Data. Compositional Data is a specific type of data where the sum of the features is always a constant. I find it very intresting to apply Machine Learning techniques to recognize and learn patterns in Data.
I am primarily intrested in Graphical Models and Deep Learning. I am also interested in working on Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning problems. You can find the details of the intresting projects that I have worked on in the Projects section.
At Oregon State, I am a Teaching Assistant for CS Senior Software Engineering Project where I help senior students in their Capstone Projects. I have also designed and taught : CS 325 Analysis Of Algorithms during the Summer of 2020.
